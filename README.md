Architecture and Design

Challenges Faced
As I face challenges throughout the development process, I will include them here.

The first challenge I faced was that I had never used TypeScript for any application before. I had seen some basic examples of it, and had a basic understanding of what it is used for, but I had never used it.

Once I completed the basic implementation, I ran into some issues with some of the required fields.  For example, the countries API did not seem to have a region field, population field, and timezone field.  To get around the region issue, I used the AWS region field.  Though, it may have been better to use the continent field, but that was not specified in the requirements.
